# Lesson_Modules

This folder contains a curated collection of practice scripts, tutorials, logic exercises, and custom problem sets created throughout my journey learning Python and applying it to data science and quantitative trading.

### Purpose

The materials in this folder are not designed to be complete, polished applications. Instead, they serve as:

- **Learning artifacts** ‚Äî including explorations of key Python and data science concepts.
- **Mini-labs** ‚Äî for testing logic, algorithms, and strategies using small, often handmade datasets.
- **Problem-solving modules** ‚Äî such as LeetCode-style challenges, custom exercises, or practical implementations tied directly to challenges I faced in larger machine learning or algorithmic trading projects.

This is where I build and refine the foundational skills that I later apply in my more advanced work.

üìÅ This folder is complemented by the [`projects`](/projects/README.md) folder, which contains scripts meant to be developed into functional tools. For full context, see the root [`README.md`](/README.md).
