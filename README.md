# Quant Learning Lab

This repository is a personal learning sandbox ‚Äî a curated collection of small projects, logic exercises, and tutorials that support my ongoing development in machine learning, algorithmic trading, and quantitative analysis.

It is **not a standalone application**, but rather a reference lab that I actively build upon while working toward mastery in quantitative finance and applied coding.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The material here reflects foundational and exploratory work. The models and systems I‚Äôm currently building are significantly more complex ‚Äî this repo exists to support that advanced development through focused experimentation and problem-solving.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

This repo is organized into two main folders:

### `projects/`
Contains Python scripts intended to serve as full or partial tools for real-world use cases.

- These are designed to perform specific tasks or support automation.
- Some projects are complete; others are in development or paused ‚Äî but all are included to maintain a clear snapshot of my iterative progress.
- Examples include: a metals price calculator, a trade-tracking tool, and message encryption scripts.

### `lesson_modules/`
A growing library of hands-on learning material, pattern drills, and problem-solving logic used to sharpen my skills in Python and machine learning.

- Includes tutorial-based scripts, LeetCode problems, and my own logic challenges.
- Frequently uses handmade datasets (e.g., simple CSVs) to isolate and solve specific issues encountered in larger trading models.
- Built to support experimentation and internalization of key concepts in ML, data manipulation, and financial modeling.

Each of these folders includes its own `README.md` for more detailed explanations of their respective contents.

## üîç Purpose

This lab acts as:
- A **knowledge base** for code patterns, workflows, and debugging strategies
- A **toolbox** I can draw from in larger machine learning and trading projects
- A **public record** of my journey from scientific researcher to data-driven technologist in the fintech space

Whether you‚Äôre curious about my process or navigating your own career change, I hope this lab helps demonstrate the power of incremental, purpose-driven learning.
