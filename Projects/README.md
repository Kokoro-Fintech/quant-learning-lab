# Projects

This folder contains Python scripts and small projects designed to solve specific problems or automate tasks.

Some scripts are fully functional tools, while others are works in progressâ€”serving as starting points for future development. These projects demonstrate practical applications of coding skills relevant to finance, data processing, and automation.

More developed projects that include detailed documentation or whitepapers are separated into their own repositories to keep this folder focused on early-stage or supporting work.

Examples of projects you might find here include:

- Trade monitoring scripts  
- Message encryption and decryption tools  
- Application usage trackers  

Each script showcases problem-solving, coding ability, and iterative development toward more complex financial or data science systems.

Feel free to explore and reach out if you have questions or collaboration ideas!
