# Projects

This folder contains Python scripts and small projects designed to solve specific problems or automate tasks.

Some scripts are fully functional tools, while others are works in progress—serving as starting points for future development. These projects demonstrate practical applications of coding skills relevant to finance, data processing, and automation.

Examples of projects you might find here include:

- Trade monitoring scripts  
- Message encryption and decryption tools  
- Application usage trackers  

Each script showcases problem-solving, coding ability, and iterative development toward more complex financial or data science systems.

> 📁 Note: More advanced or complete projects (such as those including a whitepaper or comprehensive documentation) are moved into their own repositories — for example: [metals-calculator](https://github.com/Kokoro-Fintech/metals-calculator).

Each script is either a functional utility, a prototype with a defined task, or a placeholder for an evolving idea.

📁 This folder is complemented by the [`lesson_modules`](../lesson_modules/README.md) folder, which contains scripts meant to be developed into functional tools. For full context, see the root [`README.md`](../README.md).
